Subject: [PATCH 464/634] clk: Always clamp the rounded rate

The current core while setting the min and max rate properly in the
clk_request structure will not make sure that the requested rate is
within these boundaries, leaving it to each and every driver to make
sure it is.

Add a clamp call to make sure it's always done.
